***Memorable Mechanics***
- Difficulty system (Ranger mode) that didn't just scale enemy damage and health pools, it made damage more realistic for the enemies and you
- Librarian enemies that required you to just *look* at them
- Whole levels that can be cleared without killing a single enemy

***Lessons Learned***

Difficulty by making enemies bullet sponges is lazy and uninteresting.
