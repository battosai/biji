***Memorable Mechanics***
- Dying in physical form puts you in spirit form w/ only 50% health
	- Spirit form only gives you 50% health but you can't be invaded
	- Physical form gives you 100% health but you can be invaded and summon players
- Invasion mechanic that let players forcefully join another player's game as an enemy
- Summon up to 2 other players to help you through the level and the boss
- Messages that can be placed down in the world and read by other players in their games
- Phantoms of other players actively playing
- Bloodstains that let you see how other players died
- Dying leaves all your souls (currency & exp points) on your own bloodstain where you died that you can reclaim if you make it back, otherwise losing it all if you die again
- World and character tendency systems (karmic) that change as you die or defeat bosses or kill NPCs that effect changes in the levels
	- Dying in physical form makes world tendency darker and can eventually lead to black-phantom enemies being present
	- Some areas are unlocked for different ends of the tendency ranges
- World 3-3 Old Monk boss that summons another player as the actual boss for a different player's game

***Lessons Learned***

Melee is the way. Ranged (bow/xbow) weapons felt very lackluster and magic has never really appealed to me. 

I didn't want to be invaded so I played in spirit form and just fought bosses solo. Nowhere to hide. "Got gud".

Summoning made the bosses immensely easier because they would split their attention. So much of a boss's difficulty comes from having to read their movesets and find an opening to attack or heal or recover stamina.
