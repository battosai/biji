Slipbox will eventually provide you with a skeleton of linked ideas that you can then build upon rather than starting with a blank slate (pgs. 2-3)

Smart note lifecycle (pgs. 23-24)
- Fleeting notes (AKA daily notes) --> literature notes --> permanent notes
- Fleeting notes --> permanent notes

Literature notes are summaries/paraphrases of ideas from texts AKA the text's ideas. Permanent notes are your own ideas formed from your research or readings.

Permanent notes that go into the slipbox should be atomic in meaning. They should focus on specific individual ideas that aren't large compositions. If it's a broad topic, they should merely point to the possible paths that other notes can embark in. (pg. 24)

Ideas that aren't shared are as useful as ones that you never had. What good is an idea that you keep private in your unreliable brain? (pg. 36)

Treating writing as the only metric of output will make you learn better. You don't have to do this at the expense of other things, but it shifts your focus when learning. Spend less time asking yourself what is worth writing down or what you're trying to learn. (pgs. 37-38)

Fleeting notes are reminders of thoughts while permanent notes are the actual thought themselves. (pg. 45)

The slipbox does not need to organize notes by topic. It's about how you want to discover connections between ideas later on. This saves us from having to brainstorm for things later on. (pg. 41)

Brainstorming for ideas about a specific topic is for the ill-prepared. If you're brainstorming, it's both too early and too late. Too early because you shouldn't need to spend energy remembering or generating ideas about a topic before you begin writing. Too late because you don't have time to build up a knowledge base of ideas to draw from. (pg. 49)

A healthy process is one that doesn't require willpower to engage in. It should be a frictionless feedback loop of motivation and satisfaction. (pg. 52)

Focus on the process of learning rather than achieving a specific outcome. (pg. 53)

Regularly having to review your own notes through the lifecycle is better than a formal essay review after all of the research and writing has been done. (pg. 53)

The slipbox method accommodates modifications to its knowledge base because everything is written with your own mental model. It is a two-way street. (pg. 56)

Doing something a lot doesn't make you good at it. Familiarity =/= skill. (pg. 58)
