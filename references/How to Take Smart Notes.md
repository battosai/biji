Slipbox will eventually provide you with a [[202512262249|skeleton of linked ideas]] that you can then build upon rather than starting with a blank slate (pgs. 2-3)

Smart note lifecycle (pgs. 23-24)
- Fleeting notes (AKA daily notes) --> literature notes --> permanent notes
- Fleeting notes --> permanent notes

Permanent notes that go into the slipbox should be atomic. (pg. 24)

[[202512241317|Spend less time asking yourself]] what is worth writing down or what you're trying to learn. (pgs. 37-38)

Fleeting notes are reminders of thoughts while permanent notes are the actual thought themselves. (pg. 45)

The slipbox does not need to organize notes by topic. It's about how you want to discover connections between ideas later on. (pg. 41)

If you're brainstorming, it's both too early and too late. (pg. 49)

A healthy process is one that is frictionless. (pg. 52)

Focus on the process of learning rather than achieving a specific outcome. (pg. 53)

[[202512262237|Regularly having to review]] your own notes through the lifecycle is better than a formal essay review after all of the research and writing has been done. (pg. 53)

The slipbox method accommodates modifications to its knowledge base because everything is written with your own mental model. (pg. 56)

Doing something a lot doesn't make you good at it. Familiarity =/= skill. (pg. 58)

Experience beats out formal teaching (pgs. 66-67)

Processing literature notes into your own ideas is the root of this process. (pg. 77)
