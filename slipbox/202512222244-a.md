I like PvE games, but sometimes they feel too easy and I get bored. I need them to still present a challenge even when players have a strong grasp on the mechanics. 

The challenge has to come from the game loop rather than learning curves or players blundering. 

Spirit Islands seems like a good example, but it could be because I'm still learning it and haven't mastered it to the level I want to evaluate it at.
