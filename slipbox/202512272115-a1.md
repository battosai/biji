==This is an oversimplification because it touches on philosophy (utilitarianism, totalitarianism, etc.) and systems of morality.==

Sometimes intent matters and sometimes it doesn't.

If you have good intentions, then your actions will be scrutinized more. We can ignore the obvious cases of having good intentions w/ good actions and bad intentions w/ bad actions.

Having bad intentions pretty much immediately invalidates good actions because it was either by accident or deceitful.

Having good intentions doesn't matter if your action is negative. It does not give you free reign to do whatever you want.
