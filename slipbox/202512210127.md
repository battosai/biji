Smart note lifecycle:
- Fleeting notes (AKA daily notes) --> reference notes --> Zettelkasten notes (AKA unique notes)
- Fleeting notes --> Zettelkasten notes

Reference notes can be an idea in the text, the text's name, and page number. It could be a link to a video. It just needs to be a way to reference an idea to a source.

Zettelkasten notes should be very atomic. They should be specific individual ideas that aren't large compositions.
