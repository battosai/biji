Brainstorming for ideas about a specific topic is for the ill-prepared. If you're brainstorming, it's both too early and too late. Too early because you shouldn't need to spend energy remembering or generating ideas about a topic before you begin writing. Too late because you don't have time to build up a knowledge base of ideas to draw from.

The slipbox does not need to organize notes by topic. It's about how you want to discover connections between ideas later on. This saves us from having to brainstorm for things later on.
