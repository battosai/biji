TODO:
- [ ] look at simple IRA
- [ ] figure out how to incorporate index + keywords (maybe tags? color the nodes in graph too?)

IDEAS:
- game proposal
- project hugupo
	- figure out what makes people scared
	- maybe find tunnels under the house
	- they see how it was watching them
	- maybe not hugupo exactly

NOTES:
- art of game design
	- design experiences not games pgs 11-12
	- dissect your emotions to understand why an experience in a game affected you as such pgs 18-19
		- treat the desired player emotion/experience as a user's task and bridge that gap
- design of everyday things
	-
