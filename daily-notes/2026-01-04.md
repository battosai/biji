TODO:
- [ ] look at simple IRA
- [ ] find lifting routine
- [ ] find cardio routine
- [ ] figure out how to incorporate index + keywords (maybe tags? color the nodes in graph too?)

IDEAS:
- game proposal
- project hugupo
	- figure out what makes people scared
	- maybe find tunnels under the house
	- they see how it was watching them
	- maybe not hugupo exactly

NOTES:
- talent vs practice
- more means better chance of getting something valuable? Not always
- design of everyday things
	- discoverability + understanding pg. 3
		- figure out what you can do with something, the actions possible
		- can you understand them
		- connect to [[202512241124]] maybe?
	- a lot of design is done by engineers who are experts in technology but not people pg. 6
	- focus on designing for mistakes, when things go wrong pg. 9
