TODO:
- [ ] look at simple IRA
- [ ] find lifting routine
- [ ] find cardio routine
- [ ] figure out how to incorporate index + keywords (maybe tags? color the nodes in graph too?)

IDEAS:
- game proposal
- project hugupo
	- figure out what makes people scared
	- maybe find tunnels under the house
	- they see how it was watching them
	- maybe not hugupo exactly

NOTES:
- talent vs practice
- discoverability + understanding pg. 3
	- figure out what you can do with something, the actions possible
	- can you understand them
	- connect to [[202512241124]] maybe?
