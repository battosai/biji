I'm still unsure how to manage the system of linking Zettelkasten notes

i like games (tabletop, video, etc.) that promote competition between players (PvP) because it feels like there's no point in playing efficiently

spirit islands feels different because it actually feels difficult though even with allies, so maybe the PvE has to be hard enough
