I'm still unsure how to manage the system of linking Zettelkasten notes

i like games (tabletop, video, etc.) that promote competition between players (PvP) because it feels like there's no point in playing efficiently

spirit islands feels different because it actually feels difficult even with allies, so maybe the PvE has to be hard enough

I don't like to summon or use extra tools in the souls games because originally if you wanted that help, you had to risk being invaded

elden ring subverts that a little with the summon ashes, but I'm a stickler and I think I just like the challenge. I like knowing that I can beat it at the "hardest situation" because then I know I can beat it with anything else because it'll be easier.
