Games

- i like games (tabletop, video, etc.) that promote competition between players (PvP) because it feels like there's no point in playing efficiently
- spirit islands feels different because it actually feels difficult even with allies, so maybe the PvE has to be hard enough
- I don't like to summon or use extra tools in the souls games because originally if you wanted that help, you had to risk being invaded
- elden ring subverts that a little with the summon ashes, but I'm a stickler and I think I just like the challenge. I like knowing that I can beat it at the "hardest situation" because then I know I can beat it with anything else because it'll be easier.
