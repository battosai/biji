- be mindful of your immediate perception of things, remain objective, see things as they factually are pg. 125
- states that we perceive things as a whole immediately rather than seeing then interpreting
	- books uses example of reading: we dont see lines, then interpret letters, then words, then sentences
		- for this specifically, we probably do these steps, but really fast
		- learning a new language
- think about the problems that something is solving, not just the problems that something presents pg. 128
- restricting self to help creativity
	- souls builds focused on a weapon or theme
	- warhammer lists with a theme or gimmick
