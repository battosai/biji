TODO:
- [ ] look at simple IRA
- [ ] find lifting routine
- [ ] find cardio routine
- [ ] figure out how to incorporate index + keywords (maybe tags? color the nodes in graph too?)

IDEAS:
- game proposal
- project hugupo
	- figure out what makes people scared
	- maybe find tunnels under the house
	- they see how it was watching them
	- maybe not hugupo exactly

NOTES:
- designers job to help the user understand how to use a product in a cohesive manner (signifiers incorporated into the overall experience) pgs 13-19
- helping users create a functional mental model hinges on using good mapping (spatial, cultural, natural, etc.) pg. 21-22
