TODO:
- [ ] look at simple IRA
- [ ] figure out how to incorporate index + keywords (maybe tags? color the nodes in graph too?)

IDEAS:
- game proposal
- project hugupo
	- figure out what makes people scared
		- not only the presence of eerie things, the absence of expected mundane things
	- maybe find tunnels under the house
	- they see how it was watching them
	- maybe not hugupo exactly
- physical therapy
    - irritation more so in my lower back above my right glute, related to leg

NOTES:
